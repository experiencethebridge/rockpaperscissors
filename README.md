# rockpaperscissors
C rock/paper/scissors with nested ifs inside of a do/while.  I am using notepad++ and cygwin64.  I am wanting to create a score keeper without altering this structure.  I am thinking that only a true count if will suffice, but can't think of how to count results.  This will need to take place within the do/while.
